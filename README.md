# Why this?

A simple project template for my own small cli code.  
Borrowed Makefile ideas from different sources.

This purely a "works for me" repository, and will change when I learn more go. _hopefully_

# Using


## Clone and reset:

- Clone the template repository into a new directory with a different name (e.g., my-new-project): `git clone https://github.com/falkowich/go-project-template.git my-new-project`  
Reset the .git directory by removing it: `rm -rf my-new-project/.git`

## Update the project settings:

- Update the go.mod file to reflect your new project's name and version.  
Adjust any other files or directories as needed (e.g., renaming packages, updating dependencies).

## Commit and push:
- Commit your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"`  
Push the changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub): `git push origin master`
